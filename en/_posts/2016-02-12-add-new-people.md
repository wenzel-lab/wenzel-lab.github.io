_This post from Konrad Kording's lab is an excellent resource and has survived content cleanup for this forked lab website_

Here, we provide some description on how can you add new profile to the page by editing on Github  [KordingLab/KordingLab.github.io](https://github.com/KordingLab/KordingLab.github.io). It's very simple.
You can follow the instruction below. If you have any problem, feel free to ask any lab members.

#### How to add yourself to lab page

You can add yourself to the page in `_people` folder just create file name `<firstname>_<lastname>.md` in the folder. We require few line of header before you start writing your page. See the following

```

```

If you don't have information, just leave it blank. The avatar will bring photo from images/people folder and display it on people page. You can also add photo in your own personal page the same way your add photo in blog post.

For position, you can choose position from different choices including `researchstaff`, `postdoc`, `gradstudent`, `visiting`, `others`, `undergrad`, `visiting`, `alumni`. It will put you in section that you choose.
