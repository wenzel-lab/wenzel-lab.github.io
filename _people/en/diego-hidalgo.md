- _PhD student in physics, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile_<br>

I have a degree in science with a major in physics from the Universidad de Chile and a master's degree in physics from the PUC. At the moment my research area is ultrafast optics and nonlinear optics where I focus on the interaction of light with matter. I am currently doing my PhD in physics under the supervision of Professor Birger Seifert from the Institute of Physics and Professor Tobias Wenzel from the Institute of Biological and Medical Engineering, where we are developing new Raman microscopy methods for use in the metabolic analysis of cells.
