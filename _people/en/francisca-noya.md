_Postdoc, CIFAR - PUC_<br>


I am a biochemist with a Master's degree in Biochemistry from the University of Chile, and a PhD candidate in Molecular Nutrition at Wageningen University & Research (Netherlands). I have dedicated my research to studying human taste receptors and functional foods, using cell models and intestinal organoids (3D culture). I joined Wenzel Lab sponsored by the CIFAR â€“ McMillan Multiscale Human research program, in which Dr. Tobias Wenzel is a member. I am responsible for fostering international collaborations and, together with the organoid team, bringing our work with gastric organoids to the world of microfluidics and beyond.
