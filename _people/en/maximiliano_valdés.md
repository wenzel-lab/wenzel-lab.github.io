- _Undergrad student, Engineering School, Catholic University of Chile_

I specialized in image processing during my major in Biomedical Engineering, my favorite programing language is Matlab, so much so that I used to make my screen savers in it. I like dunes and the sea together because I grew up there. In my research project, I develop optical models for multifocal microscopy.
