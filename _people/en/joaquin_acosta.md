- _Software Fellow, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile_<br>

Joaquín Acosta earned his B.S. degree in Molecular Biotechnological Engineering from the Faculty of Science at Universidad de Chile in 2023. He specialized in Bioinformatics, developing open-source software for screening antibiotic resistance genes in clinically relevant MDR bacteria in Chile. Additionally, he contributed to open-source hardware by designing and building a cost-effective Linux server for his research group, facilitating storage, analysis, and treatment of genomic data. Joaquín's curiosity has led to some awards such as 1st place at the ASM's agar art contest (Fanny Hesse) and receiving a bronze medal (Tenzyme Vilú) at the iGEM competition. In the project, he explored the integration of hardware technology and software in biological science instrumentation.
